# Advanced-Java
Advanced Java Lab Work â€“ This repository contains my daily lab exercises and implementations on Advanced Java concepts, including Servlets, JSP, JSTL, JDBC, and Spring for enterprise web application development.




âœ… Day 1 â€“ JDBC CRUD with MySQL (Statement Object)

Established JDBC connection with MySQL.

Performed CRUD operations using the Statement object:

Create â†’ Insert records

Read â†’ Retrieve records

Update â†’ Modify records

Delete â†’ Remove records



âœ… Day 2 â€“ JDBC CRUD with MySQL (PreparedStatement Object)

Implemented JDBC connectivity with MySQL using PreparedStatement.

Executed parameterized queries for secure database interaction.

Performed CRUD operations with improved efficiency and protection against SQL injection.




âœ… Day 3 â€“ JDBC with CallableStatement (Stored Procedures)

Connected Java with MySQL using CallableStatement.

Executed stored procedures for database operations.

Demonstrated usage of IN, OUT, and INOUT parameters.

Showed how CallableStatement improves reusability and efficiency in enterprise applications.




âœ… Day 4 â€“ JDBC Scrollable ResultSet Navigator

Implemented a menu-driven database navigator using Scrollable ResultSet in JDBC.

Established connection with MySQL and fetched data from the employees table.

Enabled navigation through records with operations:

Next, Previous, First, Last

Absolute (go to specific row)

Before First, After Last

Get Current Row Number

Demonstrated cursor control, row data retrieval, and resource management in JDBC.




âœ… Day 5 â€“ JDBC with Updatable ResultSet (Employee Management)

Implemented an Employee Management application using Updatable ResultSet in JDBC.

Established connection with MySQL and enabled scroll-sensitive, updatable result sets.

Features:

Display Employees â†’ Fetch and display all employee records.

Update Salary â†’ Search employee by name and update their salary directly in the ResultSet.

Demonstrated how changes in a ResultSet are immediately reflected in the database.

Includes menu-driven interface and proper resource handling.



âœ… Day 6 â€“ Servlet Test Application (Factorial, Addition, Languages)

This lab exercise demonstrates the power of Servlets by handling different kinds of dynamic web operations through form input and server-side processing.

ðŸ”¹ Features Implemented:

Factorial Servlet

Accepts a number from the user via an HTML form.Computes the factorial using Java logic inside the servlet.

Returns the result dynamically as an HTML response.

Demonstrates mathematical computation with Servlets.

Addition Servlet

Accepts two numbers as input from the user.

Computes their sum and displays the result on the browser.

Illustrates how servlets can handle arithmetic operations and user data.

Languages Servlet

Accepts multiple language selections from the user (checkbox inputs).

Displays all languages known by the user.

Demonstrates handling of multiple input values and form processing in servlets.

ðŸ”¹ Deployment Descriptor (web.xml)

Configures all three servlets with unique servlet-name and url-pattern.

Maps form actions in index.html to the respective servlets.

Ensures clean requestâ€“response flow using Servlet mappings.

ðŸ”¹ Entry Page (index.html)

Acts as a welcome page for the application.

Provides links and forms for:

Finding factorial.

Performing addition of two numbers.

Selecting known languages.




âœ… Day 7 â€“ Servlet Collaboration (Login & Welcome Servlets)

A simple Java web application demonstrating servlet collaboration and session handling.

Features

Index Page (index.html) â†’ Provides login form for user input.

Login Servlet â†’ Authenticates user credentials and forwards the request.

Welcome Servlet â†’ Displays a personalized welcome message after successful login.

Concepts Covered

Servlet collaboration using RequestDispatcher (forward & include)

Request/response handling with HttpServletRequest & HttpServletResponse

Basic session management and parameter passing
